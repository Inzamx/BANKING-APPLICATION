# BANKING-APPLICATION
A banking application using Java and MySQL, without Spring Boot and RESTful APIs, is a standalone system that handles basic financial operations through direct database interactions. It enables users to create and manage accounts, check balances, transfer funds, and view transaction history. The application communicates with MySQL using JDBC, ensuring efficient database management. Security features like user authentication and data encryption protect customer information. The system operates as a desktop or console-based application, handling transactions through structured queries and business logic within Java classes.
