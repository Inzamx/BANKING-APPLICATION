# BANKING-APPLICATION
A **banking application using Java and MySQL** is a standalone system that directly interacts with the database using **JDBC**. It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as **account creation, balance inquiries, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history tracking**. The system executes SQL queries within Java code to manage and retrieve customer data efficiently. Security features, such as **password encryption and access control**, ensure user data integrity. The application runs as a **desktop or console-based system**, handling transactions through structured queries and Java-based business logic.
